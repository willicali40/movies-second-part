# Movies Project

This project fetches data about the latest movies from The Movie Database API. This is the second part of the project. The project consists of three parts:

1. Vanilla JS with Pagination Section
2. Vanilla JS with Infinite Scroll
3. React JS with Infinite Scroll

## Part 1: Vanilla JS with Pagination Section

In this part of the project, the latest movies are fetched from The Movie Database API and displayed in a pagination section at the bottom of the page. Users can navigate through the pages to see more movies.

## Part 2: Vanilla JS with Infinite Scroll

In this part of the project, the latest movies are fetched from The Movie Database API and displayed on the page using infinite scroll. As the user scrolls down the page, more movies are loaded.

## Part 3: React JS with Infinite Scroll

In the final part of the project, the latest movies are fetched from The Movie Database API and displayed on the page using infinite scroll. This time, the project is built using React JS.

## How to Use

To use this project, simply open the index.html file for part 1 and 2, or run the React app for part 3. You will see a list of the latest movies with either a pagination section or infinite scroll, depending on which part you are using.
